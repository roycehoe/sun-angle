# Introduction

Here is the problem with my room. I am at my desk now and behind me is the only window in my room. This window faces East-ish. So, at around 9-ish/10-ish, the sun would come beaming in, casting its rays upon my screen, blinding me from doing work. I need to get up and close the curtains. I do not like that.

Now here is the problem with the sun. The sun rises at different times. In short, it is because the earth does not do a perfectly circular orbit around the sun, and the earth's axis is not perpendicular to its plane of orbit. That means, I cannot fix a time to determine when I should close my curtains, and when I can open them again. If only an application could dynamically calculate this for me.
